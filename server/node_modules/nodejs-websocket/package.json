It's useful for broadcasting a message:\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction broadcast(server, msg) {\r\n\tserver.connections.forEach(function (conn) {\r\n\t\tconn.sendText(msg)\r\n\t})\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Event: 'listening()'\r\nEmitted when the server has been bound after calling server.listen\r\n\r\n## Event: 'close()'\r\nEmitted when the server closes. Note that if connections exist, this event is not emitted until all connections are completely ended.\r\n\r\n## Event: 'error(errObj)'\r\nEmitted when an error occurs. The 'close' event will be called directly following this event.\r\n\r\n## Event: 'connection(conn)'\r\nEmitted when a new connection is made successfully (after the handshake have been completed). conn is an instance of Connection\r\n\r\n# Connection\r\nThe class that represents a connection, either a client-created (accepted by a nodejs ws server) or client connection.\r\nThe websocket protocol has two types of data frames: text and binary.\r\nText frames are implemented as simple send function and receive event.\r\nBinary frames are implemented as streams: when you receive binary data, you get a ReadableStream; to send binary data, you must ask for a WritableStream and write into it.\r\nThe binary data will be divided into frames and be sent over the socket.\r\n\r\nYou cannot send text data while sending binary data. If you try to do so, the connection will emit an \"error\" event\r\n\r\n## connection.sendText(str, [callback])\r\nSends a given string to the other side. You can't send text data in the middle of a binary transmission.\r\n\r\n`callback` will be added as a listener to write operation over the socket\r\n\r\n## connection.beginBinary()\r\nAsks the connection to begin transmitting binary data. Returns a WritableStream.\r\nThe binary transmission will end when the WritableStream finishes (like when you call .end on it)\r\n\r\n## connection.sendBinary(data, [callback])\r\nSends a single chunk of binary data (like calling connection.beginBinary().end(data))\r\n\r\n`callback` will be added as a listener to write operation over the socket\r\n\r\n## connection.close([code, [reason]])\r\nStarts the closing handshake (sends a close frame)\r\n\r\n## connection.socket\r\nThe underlying net or tls socket\r\n\r\n## connection.server\r\nIf the connection was accepted by a nodejs server, a reference to it will be saved here. null otherwise\r\n\r\n## connection.readyState\r\nOne of these constants, representing the current state of the connection. Only an open connection can be used to send/receive data.\r\n* connection.CONNECTING (waiting for handshake completion)\r\n* connection.OPEN\r\n* connection.CLOSING (waiting for the answer to a close frame)\r\n* connection.CLOSED\r\n\r\n## connection.outStream\r\nStores the OutStream object returned by connection.beginBinary(). null if there is no current binary data beeing sent.\r\n\r\n## connection.path\r\nFor a connection accepted by a server, it is a string representing the path to which the connection was made (example: \"/chat\"). null otherwise\r\n\r\n## Event: 'close(code, reason)'\r\nEmitted when the connection is closed by any side\r\n\r\n## Event: 'error(err)'\r\nEmitted in case of error (like trying to send text data while still sending binary data)\r\n\r\n## Event: 'text(str)'\r\nEmitted when a text is received. `str` is a string\r\n\r\n## Event: 'binary(inStream)'\r\nEmitted when the beginning of binary data is received. `inStream` is a ReadableStream\r\n\r\n## Event: 'connect()'\r\nEmitted when the connection is fully established (after the handshake)\r\n\r\n",
